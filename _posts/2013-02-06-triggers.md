# Reasons to use triggers #

appart that they are really cool: 

 - a trigger can examine changes on rows
 - a trigger can changes values before they are inserted or updated in the database, they can act as filters 
 - you can modify how INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE behaves

# trigger concepts #

A trigger belongs to a database, it has a name which is unique in the database. The trigger is activated when a particular king of event occurs on a given table

example:
	
	CREATE TRIGGER foo_bi
	BEFORE INSERT
	ON foo
	FOR EACH ROW
		SET NEW.bar = IF(OLD.bar = 'bar', 'bar rocks', 'foo sucks');

# creating a trigger #

	CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name
	{BEFORE | AFTER} {INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE}
	ON table_name
	FOR EACH ROW
	triggered_statement;

	CREATE TRIGER trig
	BEFORE UPDATE
	ON foo
	FOR EACH ROW
	BEGIN
		SET @var1 = OLD.bar;
		SET @var2 = OLD.foo;
		SET @var3 = NEW.foo;
	END;

# restrictions #

	- You cannot use CALL statement
	- You cannot begin or end transactions
	- You cannot create trigger for a view an TEMPORARY table or a view
	- Trigger as the same issues with binary logs and replication

# OLD with NEW #

 - at INSERT, NEW.col_name, OLD is not allowed
 - DELETE trigger, OLD.colname, NEW is not allowed
 - UPDATE, OLD is before update, NEW

OLD is read only!

# destroying a trigger #

	DROP TRIGGER foo.foo;

# privileges #

to use CREATE TRIGGER or DROP TRIGGER you must have TRIGGER privilege for the table. 

 - to use SET NEW.col_name = value, you must have UPDATE privilege on the column
 - to use NEW.col_name you must have SELECT privilege for the column
