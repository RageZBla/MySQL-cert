# Overview #

Joins permits to assemble some data in different tables. 

few things about joins in MySQL: 

 - you can join up to 61 tables
 - you should write conditions how to match data most of the time in WHERE expression
 - select with join can show columns from any tables in the join
 - since you can use multiple table, some ambiguous column name, you need to address this. 

Two types of joins 
 
 - inner joins, match two rows from 2 tables, if row doesn't match not included in the result
 - outer joins, try to match two rows from 2 tables, if row doesn't match replace the columns of one table with NULL. Two type right or left join, which rows get the NULLs in case of mismatch

# Writing inner joins #

Syntax 1 comma

	SELECT * FROM foo, bar WHERE foo.foo = bar.foo

Inner join can be switched, it woon't change result, might change the order or columns in result

	SELECT * FROM bar, foo WHERE bar.foo = foo.foo

Here again the order you write the equality in the where doesn't matter, just for make things easier you might want to keep the same order as in the FROM 

Syntax 2 INNER JOIN, JOIN

	SELECT * FROM foo INNER JOIN bar ON foo.foo = bar.foo
	SELECT * FROM foo JOIN bar ON foo.foo = bar.foo

If the two columns to make the equality have same names

	SELECT * FROM foo INNER JOIN bar USING(foo)

# Outer joins #

## Left handy ##

	SELECT * FROM foo LEFT JOIN bar USING(foo);

## Right handy ##

	SELECT * FROM foo RIGHT JOIN bar USING(foo);

# Resolving ambiguous name #

First you can too qualify everything

	SELECT foo.a, bar.a FROM foo, bar WHERE foo.foo = bar.foo

but there is the self join for those you _have_ to use table alias

	SELECT t1.a, t2.b FROM foo t1, foo t1 WHERE t1.foo = t2.foo

# Multiple table update, delete #

## Update ##

	UPDATE foo, bar SET foo.a = bar.b WHERE foo.foo = bar.foo

## Delete ##

Delete from foo

	DELETE foo FROM foo, bar WHERE foo.foo = bar.foo

Same but difference syntax

	DELETE foo USING foo, bar WHERE foo.foo = bar.foo

deleting from both tables

	DELETE foo, bar FROM foo, bar WHERE foo.foo = bar.foo
	DELETE foo, bar USING foo, bar WHERE foo.foo = bar.foo
