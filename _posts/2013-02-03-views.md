# Reasons to use views #

 - Access to data is simplified
   - a view can perform calculations, usage of aggregrations functions
   - a view can select restricted columns
   - a view can use some join or union
 - views can be used to display table contents differently to different users
 - portability: views can help to upgrade or change an application with keeping a compatible behavior

# Creating views #

	CREATE [OR REPLACE] [ALGORITHM = algo]
	VIEW view_name [(column_list)]
	AS select_statement
	[WITH [CASCADED | LOCAL] CHECK OPTION]

When WITH CHECK OPTION is included in a view definition, all data changes is checked to verify if the after change the row would be still included in the views, if it is not the case the changes are rejected

Views and base table share the same namespace, so if a table or view already exists with same name. 

a view should contain unique column names, you have to use the column list if it is not the case.
 
Some behavior of views: 
 
 - a view definition can include a WHERE statement, if the query using the view is also using a where conditions are combined using AND operator
 - If a view definition includes an order BY clause, if the query use a ORDER BY the view definition one is ignored
 - for some options the behaviour for example: HIGH_PRIORITY, it is better not to include such options in the view definition

 # Restrictions on views #

  - You can't create temporary views
  - you cannot associate triggers with views
  - the table you base the views must exists
  - the select statement in the view definitions can't contain: 
    - subqueries in FROM
    - references to temp tables
    - references to user variables
    - reference to procedure parameters, if the view definition occurs withing a stored routine
    - references to prepared statement parameters

# View algorihms #

3(actually 2 ) algos: 

 - UNDEFINED: let MySQL choose appropriate algorithm
 - MERGE: MySQL merge the view definition with the query 
 - TEMPTABLE: MySQL use a temporary table to process the queries, using this algorithm you can't update the view since it would only update the temp table

 The merge algorithm requires a one-to-one relationship between the rows in the view and the rows in the base table. 

 Specifying the algorithm is usually unnessary: 

  - if you don't specify it, MySQL use the proper algo, merge if possible
  - if you specify merge algorithm but the condition required are not met, MySQL reset the algo to UNDEFINED and emit a warning

# Updating views #

you might use UPDATE and INSERT, simply when using INSERT you have to make sure that all the columns not present in the view accept NULL or have default values

WITH CHECK OPTION make sure that any data you insert or update on the views meet the requirements to be on the view, if not the insert/update is rejected. WITH CHECK OPTION has the following options: 

 - LOCAL: check only applies to the view own WHERE
 - CASCADED: check applies to view where and any views used in the view definition, default mode

 WITCH CHECK OPTION is only allowed on views that can be updated, views with the TEMPTABLE algo can't be updated! 

 # Altering views #

 	ALTER VIEW foo AS SELECT foo FROM bar; 

 # Dropping views #

 	DROP VIEW [IF EXISTS] view_name[, view_name];

 # Checking views #

 	CHECK TABLE v\G

You can check views because sometimes base table changes and the view doesn't work anymore

 # Obtaining view metadata #

 	SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.VIEWS
 	WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'foo' AND TABLE_SCHEMA = 'fooland';


 	SHOW CREATE VIEW FooView;

This also work: 

 	- DESCRIBE and SHOW COLUMNS
 	- SHOW TABLE STATUS
 	- SHOW TABLES

If you want to differentiate view from base table

 	SHOW FULL TABLES from foo;

# Privileges required for views #

required privileges: 

  - For each table column used in the views (SELECT part) you have some privileges such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE
  - for columns accessed elsewhere such in WHERE or GROUP BY you need SELECT privilege

To use OR REPLACE or ALTER view you need DROP privileges

DROP view requires DROP privleges

To access view is pretty much same privileges as base table, SELECT, UPDATE ,DELETE, INSERT privileges

Privileges for views apply to the views not the base table, so you can give access to restricted columns via views 

SHOW CREATE view requires SELECT priviles. If the view definition refers to table you have no privileges on it also requires SHOW VIEW privilege.
